  "whatItDoes": "Deploys OpenClaw on a DigitalOcean droplet ($6/month) with full messaging integration. The installer runs from your local machine, SSHs into the droplet, installs OpenClaw with systemd persistence, and walks you through connecting WhatsApp (with a dedicated number), Telegram (via BotFather), and Gmail (via Pub/Sub). After setup, your AI assistant responds on all three channels.",
