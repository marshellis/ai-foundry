  "whatItDoes": "Once installed, Igor monitors your GitHub repository for issues labeled 'claude-incremental'. Each issue should contain a checklist of tasks. Every day at 2 AM UTC (or when triggered manually), Igor picks the next unchecked task, reads your codebase for context, implements the change on a new branch, opens a pull request, and checks off the task. You review and merge the PR like any other contribution. Over time, Igor chips away at large projects one task at a time.",
